## Solutions Cracking The Coding Interview

I followed the advise in the book and code a solution first in a plain text editor without any IDE features or highlighting.    
Solutions are then validated in Compiler Explorer. 
In the sub folders you can find the `*.cpp` files and I list the Compiler Explorer links below so one can quickly test it. 

I'm sharing this here because "why not ?" and git is an easy backup solution for this.   
There are solutions in the bock so I don't know if this if going to be the slightest bit useful to anyone else.   
But to you my dear internet stranger who somehow manged to end up here: feel free to use this however you want :wink:
